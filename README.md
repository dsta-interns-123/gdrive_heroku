There are multiple branches in this repository. Not all branches are working. The branches are not deleted now for easy backtracking. Should the repository have too many branches or if it gets too messy you may want to delete branches that are not working.

For future edits, please create new branches and name the branch such that the purpose of the branch can be easily deduced. Refrain from making any edits on the master branch. The master branch is the first successful branch created and forked from TayKaiJun/gdrive_heroku repository. 

Here is a list of working branches as of 8 March 2019.
